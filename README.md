# CSSS-CABD

Welcome to the course.

You should download this repository to get a copy of the materials for Monday and Tuesday. I'll update this again before class on Wednesday.

During lectures, you should have the matching notebook that ends with "Student.ipynb" up and running. You can also run the notebook that I'll be displaying.

If you want, you can join the course [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/oss-bigdata/shared_invite/MjE5NTExMDg3NDc0LTE1MDEzNTcwNjQtMDYwMGQyMWFhMw). This will be useful for sharing information during and after lectures.
